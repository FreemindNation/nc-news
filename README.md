## General Information
The NC News React app is a news aggregation site that allows users to browse through articles by topic, sort articles, read content, and interact with it through voting and commenting. Although the app currently has a single, hardcoded logged-in user, it allows for the deletion of that userâ€™s comments.

## Features
- **View All Articles:** See a list of all articles across different topics.
- **Filter by Topic:** Filter articles by topics like cooking, football, and more.
- **Sort Articles:** Sort by date, votes, or comment count in both ascending and descending order.
- **Individual Article Page:** Read the article content and view the associated comments.
- **Voting and Commenting:** Vote articles up or down and post comments. Vote other users' comments up or down. Users can also delete their own comments.
